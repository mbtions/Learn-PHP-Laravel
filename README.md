  What is a framework?
  A framework is a reusable, standardized structure or set of guidelines that provides a foundation for developing
  software, applications, or other complex systems. It offers a pre-defined architecture, tools, and sometimes even
  pre-built components, allowing developers to build upon it rather than starting from scratch. Think of it as a
  blueprint or skeleton that dictates how different parts of a system should be organized and interact.

  Structure, Reusability, Extensibility, Standardization, and Inversion of Control:
  are the key characteristics of a framework.

  Examples: Laravel, Django, Angular, and Flutter, etc.
